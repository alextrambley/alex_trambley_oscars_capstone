# Alex Trambley's Oscars Capstone
This is my Capstone project for the Data Analytics Cohort 1. I decided to focus on films that were nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award, and look at what makes a winner!

# Sourcing the Data

## Academy Award Films - Gotta Get Em' All
> I first needed to find a list of all of the films that have been nominated by the Academy for any category during its history. 
> I sourced this search via a table I found on [another Github sourcing all of the Oscar winners from 1927 - 2017](https://datahub.io/rufuspollock/oscars-nominees-and-winners) that scraped the [Academy Awards Database website](http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/).

# Pairing The Awards Data With More Info

## OMDb API Is Where It's At
> From here I found the [OMDb API Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) as a location that I could use to get information about each film 
> including Genre, Release Data, Country of Origin, Language, Director, Actors, etc.

> This API is sourced using information found from [the IMDB official site](https://www.imdb.com/).

# Working With The Data

To start working with the data, I imported my complete films table into a Jupyter Notebook using Python. I then filtered out the films by category, searching by the categories associated with "Best Picture". This included:
<b>
* BEST PICTURE
* OUTSTANDING PICTURE
* OUTSTANDING PRODUCTION
* OUTSTANDING MOTION PICTURE
* BEST MOTION PICTURE
</b>
This was necessary as the names of the categories changed over time. 

-----
> Then, I filtered out the categories associated with acting (any categories that included the letters "ACT" in the title) so that I could use this table as a source of nominations in categories other than Best Picture. I also did this same filtering for all of the other categories __NOT__ associated with acting as their own dataframe so that their values could be referenced against the Best Picture values in a separate table.
-----
> After obtaining the list of films nominated for the Best Picture (or associated name) award, I then created a function within Python to pull all of the information for each film from the OMDb API. During this process, I discovered that there were some films that either had naming or release year issues when referencing the OMDb API. To remedy this, as part of the function I created, an "error" list was generated so that I could manually address any film titles that did not work with a normal pull.

> With the error list I had to manually check the film release year against IMDb and make sure that I had the correct film and IMDb ID. This was done with about 45 films.

> Now that the error list was completed and fixed, I was able to start cleaning up the data frames within Python to include a new piece of information, release month, as well as trimming down categorical variables like Language, Country, Genre, and more. These changes were completed by going back and forth between Python and Excel with the Python generated CSVs.
