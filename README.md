# Alex Trambley's Oscars Capstone
This is my Capstone project for the Data Analytics Cohort 1. I decided to focus on films that were nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award, and look at what makes a winner!

I first needed to find a list of all of the films that have been nominated by the Academy for any category during its history. 
I sourced this search via a table I found on https://datahub.io/rufuspollock/oscars-nominees-and-winners that scraped the http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ website.

From here I found the http://www.omdbapi.com/ API as a location that I could use to get information about each film including Genre, Release Data, Country of Origin, Language, Director, Actors, etc.

This API is sourced using information found from https://www.imdb.com/.
